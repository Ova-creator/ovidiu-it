      <h2>Introduction: why website cost is a tricky question</h2>
      <p>One of the most common questions from UK businesses is simple: <em>“How much does a website cost?”</em> The reality is more nuanced. Pricing depends on scope, design, technology stack, SEO needs, and even the readiness of your content. In 2025, businesses in London, Manchester, Birmingham and across the UK face a competitive digital market where your website is often the first impression. Understanding what drives cost helps you plan effectively — and avoid both underinvestment and overspending.</p>

      <h2>Cheap websites vs professional builds</h2>
      <p>At the low end, you can register with platforms like Wix, Squarespace or template-based WordPress. These “DIY” sites may cost as little as £300–£800. But they often come with hidden limitations: slow load times, poor SEO structures, cookie-cutter designs, and limited ownership. On the other end of the spectrum are boutique agencies or specialised developers (like Ovidiu.IT) who deliver bespoke Next.js builds with SEO baked in from day one. These projects cost more — but they are designed to convert visitors into customers and scale with your business.</p>

      <h2>Key factors influencing website cost</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Number of pages</strong> — A 3–5 page brochure site costs far less than a 20+ page site with multiple service areas, blog, and resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Design complexity</strong> — Minimalist vs advanced design systems, animations, and branding assets add hours and cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology stack</strong> — Next.js, Tailwind, and Vercel deliver blazing fast performance, but require specialised skills compared to template-based WordPress.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO integration</strong> — Metadata, JSON-LD, sitemaps, robots, internal linking, and content strategy all impact cost.</li>
        <li><strong>Content readiness</strong> — If you have copy and images ready, development is faster. If you need content creation, expect higher fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations</strong> — Forms, Google Sheets automations, Slack/Trello workflows, e-commerce checkout, booking systems — each adds complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting and ownership</strong> — In our case, clients own their Vercel hosting and GitHub repo. Transparency means fewer surprises but slightly higher upfront setup time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pricing ranges in the UK (2025)</h2>
      <p>Here’s what UK businesses can realistically expect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic (Starter)</strong>: from £1,500 — 3–5 pages, custom design, Next.js build, SEO foundations.</li>
        <li><strong>Business (Most Popular)</strong>: £3,000–£6,000 — 5–10 pages, UX-driven design, CMS integration (Sanity/Notion), tracking setup, SEO optimisation.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced / AI</strong>: £6,000–£10,000+ — bespoke features, automations (Google Apps Script, Sheets, Email), AI-assisted branding and content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Timelines and delivery</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic site</strong>: 2–3 weeks (content ready).</li>
        <li><strong>Business site</strong>: 4–6 weeks (with staged reviews and feedback loops).</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced / AI</strong>: 6–10 weeks depending on integrations and automation layers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hidden costs to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Locked-in proprietary CMS (you don’t own your content).</li>
        <li>Overuse of plugins that bloat performance.</li>
        <li>No SEO or accessibility checks.</li>
        <li>Hosting billed at inflated rates with no transparency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Next.js matters for cost efficiency</h2>
      <p>Next.js isn’t just a developer trend. It offers hybrid rendering, first-class SEO, built-in performance features, and flexible integration with modern stacks. For UK businesses, this means fewer long-term headaches.</p>

      <h2>Case example: affordable vs strategic choice</h2>
      <p>A London café owner might choose a £500 Wix site. Six months later, the site is slow, ranks poorly, and doesn’t allow online bookings. They then pay £3,500 for a rebuild. In contrast, investing £3,000 upfront for a Next.js site with SEO and booking integration would have saved time, money, and reputation.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion: investment, not expense</h2>
      <p>A website in the UK is not just a digital brochure — it’s your sales engine. Whether you spend £1,500 or £10,000+, the key is aligning scope with business goals. Cheap builds can cost more long-term. Professional, SEO-ready websites position you ahead of competitors.</p>

      <h2>Introduction: UK SEO in 2025</h2>
      <p>The UK SEO landscape in 2025 is more competitive than ever. Search intent has shifted, AI is influencing content creation, and Google’s algorithms reward clarity, trust and user experience. For UK businesses, simply stuffing keywords is no longer enough. The winners invest in strong technical foundations, intent-mapped content, and measurable strategies. This article explores what really works for UK SEO in 2025.</p>

      <h2>1. Technical SEO remains the foundation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>: Google still prioritises fast load times and responsive interactions.</li>

        <li><strong>Schema (JSON-LD)</strong>: Use Article, FAQ, Product, and Service schema to increase rich result eligibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Sitemaps & robots</strong>: Updated, submitted to Search Console, with crawlable structures.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: WCAG compliance matters — both legally and for ranking signals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Align content with UK search intent</h2>

        <li>Use original images/screenshots instead of stock.</li>
        <li>Include author bios and company details in the About/Contact pages.</li>
        <li>Reference UK-specific stats and regulations (GDPR, NHS, FCA).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Backlinks and trust signals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Business Profile and UK directories (Yell, Clutch, DesignRush).</li>
        <li>Guest posts on Medium, Dev.to, LinkedIn Pulse.</li>
        <li>Engage in UK communities (Reddit r/EntrepreneurUK, IndieHackers).</li>
